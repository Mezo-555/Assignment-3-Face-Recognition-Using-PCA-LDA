# Face Recognition and Classification using PCA and LDA

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a complete face recognition system using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** on the ORL face dataset. Additionally, it includes a binary classification task to distinguish **face vs. non-face** images. The system uses dimensionality reduction and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for classification.
